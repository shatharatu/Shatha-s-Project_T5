##Houses Price Prediction Using Linear Regression 
#Motivation :
most people know the benefit of owning a house, because buying a house is considered the most utilised and profitable investment.
an accurate prediction on the house price is important to prospective homeowners, developers, investors, appraisers
and other real estate market participants, such as, mortgage lenders and insurers.

#Algorthim :
- I approached this problem with supervised machine learning (Linear Regression ),
 it's a regression task because we are being asked to predict a numerical outcome (Price).
- Score metric will be used to evaluate the model.

#Tools :
-Jupiter and excel will be used in the work.
-Sklearn , panda , numpy , matplotlib and seaborn libraries will be used in the work.
